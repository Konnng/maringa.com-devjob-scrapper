# Maringá Dev Jobs!
### taken from maringa.com/empregos

Currently, in Maringá (Brazil), there are few places where you can look for dev jobs. The main one of them, the [maringa.com](http://www.maringa.com) website, has little usability and user experience.

Based on this problem, this small, simple html scrapper was created to scan the site for job openings and display a better formatted html. Powered by Node.js.

#### Using:

First git checkout this repo, go to the root dir and run ```npm install```. If you want to develop, run also ```npm install --only=dev```.

Generating output:

```
# node index.js
```

After scrapping, a HTML will be generated in ```/out/jobs.html```
